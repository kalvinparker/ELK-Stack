# ELK-Stack (forked)

This repository is a fork of the original "Getting started with the Elastic Stack and Docker Compose: Part 2" example. The upstream content (blog and demo) is maintained by Elastic and available at:

- Upstream blog: https://www.elastic.co/blog/getting-started-with-the-elastic-stack-and-docker-compose-part-2
- Upstream repo: https://github.com/elkninja/elastic-stack-docker-part-two

This fork contains personal modifications and improvements to make the stack easier to run locally, improve reproducibility, and add basic CI validation for the compose stack. If you're interested in the original upstream project, please refer to the links above.

NOTE: This README documents both the original upstream guidance and the changes made in this fork. Use the Getting Started section below to run this repository locally.

## My work / Changelog (what I changed in this fork)

- Centralized image pins into environment variables in `.env` (ES_IMAGE, KIBANA_IMAGE, METRICBEAT_IMAGE, FILEBEAT_IMAGE, LOGSTASH_IMAGE, ELASTIC_AGENT_IMAGE). This makes rotating digests easier and limits changes to one file.
- Added `.env.example` with placeholder values for local development and to prevent accidental secrets being committed.
- Upgraded the `app` Dockerfile to Python 3.11 and fixed dependency resolution in `app/requirements.txt` (so the `webapp` builds reliably).
- Fixed YAML/formatting issues in `docker-compose.yml` and removed the deprecated top-level `version` key.
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/validate-stack.yml` that validates `docker-compose config` and builds the `webapp` as part of CI.
- Added a small README "Getting Started" section and documented recommended `.env` values for local dev.

If you'd like a full diff or a PR link for these changes, I can include that here (or link to the branch/PR I used).

## SDLC / Development Process used for this fork

This fork follows a small, pragmatic SDLC suitable for demo or POC projects:

1. Work is done on feature branches (e.g. `chore/move-digests-to-env`).
2. Changes are validated locally (`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml config` and `docker-compose build webapp`).
3. A branch is pushed and a pull request is opened for review.
4. CI runs (`validate-stack.yml`) which currently:
	- Validates `docker-compose config` to detect YAML/syntax errors.
	- Builds the `webapp` image to ensure Dockerfile and Python dependencies are valid.
	- Optionally runs a secrets scan to prevent accidental commits of sensitive values.
5. After CI passes and review, the branch is merged into `main` and the changes are deployed or tagged as needed.

Good practices applied here:
- Pin images by digest for reproducible runs.
- Keep secrets out of the repository (`.env` is in `.gitignore`; `.env.example` contains placeholders).
- Use short-lived, fineâ€‘grained tokens for any automation that needs GitHub API access.

## How to run (local development)

1. Copy or review the existing `.env` at the repo root and update secrets/passwords before starting.

2. Build the local `webapp` service (validates Dockerfile and Python dependencies):

```powershell
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" build webapp
```

3. Start the stack (this will pull images and start services):

```powershell
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up
```

4. Access Kibana at: https://localhost:5601 (adjust port if you changed `KIBANA_PORT` in `.env`).

5. To stop and remove containers (local dev):

```powershell
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" down -v
```

## Recommended `.env` values (edit for your environment)

Below are the local/dev recommended values already present in `.env`. Change passwords and keys for any real usage.

```properties
# Project namespace
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=es

# Passwords (change!)
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=changeme
KIBANA_PASSWORD=changeme

# Elastic Stack version (tag used only for Kibana; other images are pinned by digest in docker-compose.yml)
STACK_VERSION=8.10.0

# Cluster and service ports
ES_PORT=9200
KIBANA_PORT=5601
FLEET_PORT=8220
APMSERVER_PORT=8200

# Memory limits for local/dev
ES_MEM_LIMIT=1g
KB_MEM_LIMIT=512m
LS_MEM_LIMIT=512m

# APM Secret Token (change)
ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN=changeme_apm_token

# Encryption key (POC only)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=changeme_encryption_key
```

If you'd like me to add a sample `.env.example` file to the repo, I can create it and reference it from this README.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the example environment file:

```powershell
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and replace all `CHANGEME_*` values with your actual secrets and configuration.

3. Build the webapp image:

```powershell
docker-compose build webapp
```

4. Start the stack:

```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```
